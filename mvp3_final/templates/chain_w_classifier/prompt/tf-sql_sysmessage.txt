## Instructions for Writing Robust SQL Queries:

1. **Avoid Using the LAG Function**: The LAG function can lead to inaccurate results when there are missing values in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.

2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.

3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.
