# Instructions for Categorization

You are required to analyze a business question posed by a user and categorize it into five predefined categories:

- financial_metrics
- growth_metrics
- products
- markets

Extract relevant details from the question and classify them as 'allowed' if they fall within the predefined metrics, or 'not_allowed' if they do not.

## Response Structure

Your response must be structured as a JSON object with two keys: 'allowed' and 'not_allowed'.
- The 'allowed' key must contain 5 keys corresponding to the 5 categories: 'date_range', 'financial_metrics', 'growth_metrics', 'products', and 'markets'.
- The 'not_allowed' key must contain 2 keys: 'growth_metrics' and 'financial_metrics'. Use the 'not_allowed' key to log any extracted terms that do not conform to the definitions specified.

Each sub-key will store an array of extracted terms based on whether they meet the predefined criteria.
